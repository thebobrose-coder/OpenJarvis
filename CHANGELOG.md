## [Unreleased]

### Added

**Apple Foundation Models (AFM 3)** — a new in-process `afm` engine drives
Apple's `apple-fm-sdk` directly, with no HTTP hop and no second process whose
CPU draw would land inside the same energy measurement window. Install with
`DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer uv sync --extra afm`
(the SDK compiles Swift bindings, so a full Xcode is required), then
`jarvis ask --engine afm --model afm-3-core "..."`. Requires an Apple Silicon
Mac on macOS 26+ with Apple Intelligence enabled.

Token counts are real, via `SystemLanguageModel.token_count` (added in SDK
0.2.1, hence the floor). Because `token_count` rejects a value and
instructions together, both ends are measured against the session transcript:
`prompt_tokens = <transcript before> + <prompt alone>` and
`completion_tokens = <transcript after> - prompt_tokens`.

Two caveats worth reading before comparing AFM numbers to other backends:
`stream_response` yields cumulative snapshots batching roughly 8-10 tokens, so
`ttft` is time-to-first-*chunk* (~450 ms on an M1 Pro) and derived
inter-token latencies are inter-chunk; and the SDK exposes no variant
selector, so `afm-3` / `afm-3-core` / `afm-3-core-advanced` are run labels
only — the framework's dynamic profile chooses what actually executes.
Bench results record `metadata["engine_info"]` (SDK version, context size,
host chip) so a run can be attributed after the fact.

**Eval results record which rail did the work.** Result rows and summaries
previously carried only `energy_joules` and `power_watts`, so nothing in an
eval artifact distinguished a Neural Engine run from an idle GPU, or a
hardware measurement from a modelled estimate. Rows now include the per-rail
breakdown (`cpu`/`gpu`/`dram`/`ane`/`soc`), `energy_basis`, and
`energy_method`; summaries add `energy_joules_by_rail` alongside both. On a
ToolCall-15 run against AFM the ANE rail is the largest single component —
91.7 J of 223.7 J, against 3.0 J on the GPU — which is now visible in the
file rather than only through live instrumentation.

**ANE and whole-SoC energy** — `EnergySample.ane_energy_joules` existed but
died at the monitor boundary. Apple Neural Engine and a whole-SoC total now
flow through `TelemetryRecord`, the SQLite schema (with an `ADD COLUMN`
migration), the aggregator, `TelemetrySession`, eval `TurnTrace`/`QueryTrace`,
and bench metadata, alongside an `energy_basis` marker (`"soc"` on Apple
Silicon, `"gpu"` elsewhere) so downstream repeats the monitor's choice instead
of guessing. This matters because AFM runs predominantly on the ANE: measured
on an M1 Pro, one generation drew 0.98 J on the ANE against 0.014 J on the
GPU rail — 70x — where an MLX matmul on the same machine drew 8.99 J on the
GPU and nothing on the ANE.

**Vision input for `jarvis ask`** — attach images to a query with
`-i`/`--image` (repeatable) or capture the current screen with
`-S`/`--screen`, for vision-capable models such as `gemma3:4b`. Images flow
through `Message.images` into Ollama's `/api/chat` `images` field; text-only
requests are unaffected. A privacy guard warns before any image is sent to a
non-local engine, and the security guardrail now preserves images when it
sanitizes a flagged prompt. Screen capture uses the built-in Windows .NET
stack with `mss`/`Pillow` fallbacks on other platforms. Adds the
`JARVIS_NUM_CTX` environment variable to tune the Ollama context window
(default `16384`).

**Dedicated Briefing page for the morning digest.** The digest previously
surfaced only by piggybacking on whatever chat message happened to be
current -- `InputArea.tsx` polled `/api/digest` after every response and
attached audio to it when available. A new sidebar entry and `/briefing`
route give it its own page: narrative text, the existing `AudioPlayer`,
a Regenerate button, and digest history, all against the existing
`/api/digest` REST endpoints (no backend changes required). The
chat-hijack in `InputArea.tsx` stays in place for now, pending removal
once the new page is proven out.

### Fixed

**Backend console window killed the server when closed** (Windows
desktop). Every `uv.exe`/`git.exe` child spawned from the GUI-subsystem
desktop app got its own console window -- `CreateProcess`'s default when
no console-suppression flag is set. Closing that window sent
`CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT` to the console host, killing `jarvis serve` along
with it, so a production build appeared to require a terminal window
left open to stay running. Fixed by setting `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on every
backend subprocess spawn: the Ollama sidecar, git clone, `uv sync`, the
Rust-extension verification, and `jarvis serve` itself on both the boot
path and the manual `run_jarvis_command` path.

**`tauri build` hard-failed on drifted plugin versions.**
`tauri-plugin-notification`/`tauri-plugin-updater`'s npm packages and
Rust crates had drifted to different minor versions over time (both
manifests pin loosely, `"2"` / `"^2"`). `tauri dev` tolerates the
mismatch; `tauri build` does not -- it exits immediately with "Found
version mismatched Tauri packages" before compiling anything. Realigned
both sides to matching versions (notification 2.4.0, updater 2.12.0).

**Desktop pinned a stale model from first-run onboarding.** The desktop
app resolves its Ollama model from `~/.openjarvis/inference.json`
(written once during setup), not from `config.toml`, and passes it as an
explicit `--model` flag to `jarvis serve` -- which wins over
`config.toml`'s `default_model`. A model changed later via `config.toml`
or the CLI silently had no effect on desktop-app launches.

**`jarvis start` crashed on its own PID registration** (Windows).
`Popen.pid` for a `DETACHED_PROCESS` child can disagree with that same
process's own `os.getpid()`, so the daemon's pending-placeholder check
(PID equality) treated a server as conflicting with itself. Fixed with a
shared launch token, handed to the child via an env var, to prove
placeholder ownership instead.

**Desktop health probe misread a slow-starting server as an empty
port.** A single 2s `/health` timeout tripping on a slow-but-healthy
first response fell through to spawning a duplicate server, which then
collided with the real one on the raw TCP bind. Now retries up to 3
times before concluding the port is genuinely empty -- a truly empty
port still fails near-instantly on every attempt.

**Boot-time `uv sync` silently pruned the `voice` extra.** Every backend
boot re-runs `uv sync` reconciled to a hardcoded extras list; anything
installed outside that list (e.g. `voice`, for Kokoro TTS) was
uninstalled on the very next app restart. Added `voice` to the boot
sync list.

**`OperatorManager.activate()` duplicated scheduler tasks.**
`create_task()` always persists a task under a fresh random uuid4-hex
id; `activate()` renamed it to a deterministic `operator:<id>` by
resaving a mutated copy under that id, but never removed the original
row -- leaving it active, so it fired its own tick alongside the renamed
one every cycle. Now deletes the original row once the deterministic-id
row is saved.

**Morning digest wrote only to its own store, invisible to every other
agent.** `MorningDigestAgent` wrote exclusively to `DigestStore`;
operators and managed agents had no way to draw on the daily digest via
`memory_retrieve`. Now also writes a best-effort copy to the shared
`memory_store` pool, tagged `source="daily_briefing"`. The agent is also
now instructed to skip email administrivia (subscription confirmations,
"welcome to X" messages) rather than report it as briefing content. Its
strict word limit was widened from 200 to 275 words for more narrative
room without added TTS risk.

**`jarvis digest --fresh --text-only` played audio anyway.** The
cached-digest display path gated playback on `not text_only`; the
`--fresh` generation path didn't, so `--text-only` never actually
suppressed audio playback for a freshly generated digest.

**Apple Silicon energy was never measured, only modelled.**
`telemetry/energy_apple.py` imported `AppleSiliconMonitor` from
`zeus.device.soc.apple`; no such class has ever existed there. The import
raised on every machine, so the CPU-time fallback -- `wall_clock x TDP x 0.60`
split by four hardcoded ratios -- was the only path that ever ran. It read no
counters and no utilization, so a ten-second sleep and a ten-second generation
produced identical joules, and every Apple Silicon figure in the telemetry DB,
eval traces and `jarvis bench` came from it. Renaming the import would not
have helped: `zeus.device.soc` landed on zeus master after the last zeus
release, so no published `zeus-ml` contains it, and `zeus-ml` has no `apple`
extra either. `energy-apple` now installs `zeus-apple-silicon`, the IOReport
extension zeus itself wraps, which needs no root. Measured on an M1 Pro:
8.24 W under load against 3.72 W idle, where the previous code could not tell
the two windows apart.

`AppleEnergyMonitor.available()` now reports `False` when nothing is
measurable, instead of `True` on any Apple Silicon host, so the factory falls
through rather than letting a model masquerade as a measurement. The estimate
remains reachable through the new `telemetry.allow_energy_estimates` setting
and still reports `energy_method = "tdp_estimate"`.

`snapshot()` is implemented for the first time, so `TelemetrySession`'s
background sampler -- the path agentic evals use -- records real readings
rather than the ABC's empty default. Relatedly, `TelemetrySample` hardcoded
`cpu_power_w = 0.0`, which zeroed CPU power in every eval trace on every
platform.

**`apple_fm` shim reported zero token counts.** It hardcoded zeros with a note
that the SDK did not expose counts; SDK 0.2.1 added `token_count`. Zeroed
`completion_tokens` zeroes throughput, `energy_per_output_token_joules` and
`tokens_per_joule` for everything served through the shim. Streaming responses
now also carry `usage` on the final chunk. The install hint no longer tells
users to clone from GitHub -- `apple-fm-sdk` is on PyPI. System messages become
the session's `instructions` rather than being prefixed onto the prompt as
`[System] ...`, which discarded a distinction the SDK draws and inflated the
prompt-token count.

**`scripts/setup-energy-monitor.sh` did not exist**, though
`jarvis bench --setup-energy` built a path to it and offered to run it -- so
the offer silently did nothing.

### Security

**WebSocket API keys no longer appear in request URLs.** Browser clients now
send a marked, base64url-encoded credential through
`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`; programmatic clients can continue to use an
`Authorization: Bearer <key>` handshake header. The encoding only makes the
credential safe for WebSocket protocol syntax and does not encrypt it, so use
`wss://` for remote connections.

The former `?token=<key>` WebSocket authentication path is no longer accepted.
Custom browser clients must migrate to the `openjarvis.auth.v1` subprotocol
format documented in the API server guide.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-24

A patch release that fixes a packaging bug which broke the v1.0.1
wheel on PyPI, silences a noisy startup warning, restores a working
install path while `openjarvis.ai` is down, improves desktop
first-boot diagnostics on Windows, and ships the RAM-detection fix
for Windows that missed the v1.0.1 cutoff.

### Fixed

**`openjarvis/traces/` missing from the v1.0.1 PyPI wheel** (#372).
The `.gitignore` carried an unanchored `traces/` pattern, which
hatchling honored at wheel-build time and matched the runtime module
`src/openjarvis/traces/` — silently dropping the whole package. Every
fresh `pip install openjarvis==1.0.1` then failed at import with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openjarvis.traces'` on the
first `jarvis ask`, learning, or server call. Anchored the pattern to
`/traces/`. Verified: a clean `uv build` now produces a wheel
containing all four `traces/` files.

**`pynvml` deprecation `FutureWarning` on every command** (#389).
Switched the dependency from the legacy `pynvml` package to NVIDIA's
official `nvidia-ml-py` (same `pynvml` module name, no warning shim),
and added defensive `warnings.filterwarnings` at every `import pynvml`
site to suppress the warning even when `pynvml` is pulled in
transitively.

**Windows RAM detection returning `0.0 GB`** (#373). The Windows
branch of `_total_ram_gb()` (via `GlobalMemoryStatusEx`) landed after
the v1.0.1 cutoff, so v1.0.1 users still saw `0.0 GB` from `jarvis
init`. Now shipping in the wheel. A new `windows-latest` CI job runs
the real `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` path on every PR as a regression
guard.

**Desktop first-boot hung on "did not become healthy in time"**
(#331). The Tauri boot path ran `uv sync` with stderr discarded and
the exit code ignored, so a failed dependency install surfaced only
as a generic 600-second health-check timeout. Now captures stderr,
checks the exit status, and surfaces the actual `uv sync` error
(with the diagnostic tail) before the long wait. The error-formatting
logic is covered by unit tests.

### Changed

**Install URL moved to GitHub Pages** (#337, #352). The documented
`openjarvis.ai/install.sh` URL was failing with `sslv3 alert
handshake failure` (the domain is community-operated and had a broken
TLS config). The canonical installer is now served from the
project-controlled GitHub Pages site at
`https://open-jarvis.github.io/OpenJarvis/install.sh`, generated from
the same `scripts/install/install.sh` at docs-build time. The README
also documents the WSL2 path for Windows and the `uv` prerequisite
for the desktop binary, and the installer bails early with a clear
message when run under Git Bash / MSYS2 / Cygwin.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-17

A patch release that closes the auto-update gap so the analytics
module added in #351 actually reaches users on the desktop, adds
runtime opt-out for that analytics, fixes the misleading upgrade
hint the CLI was printing, and lands the ACE optimizer alongside
DSPy and GEPA.

### Added

**ACE agent optimizer** (`learning/agents/ace_optimizer.py`). Adds
[ACE](https://github.com/ace-agent/ace) as a third agent-learning
policy alongside DSPy and GEPA. Where DSPy bootstraps few-shot
examples and GEPA evolves prompt populations, ACE evolves a textual
*playbook* of strategies the agent reads at inference time, updated
by a Generator / Reflector / Curator triad. Pick via
`[learning.agent] policy = "ace"`. Setup is manual (ACE isn't on
PyPI and isn't a properly-packaged Python project as of v1.0.1) —
see `docs/learning/ace.md` for the install path and trace-adapter
behavior.

**`jarvis self-update`** subcommand. Detects how OpenJarvis was
installed (pip, uv tool, editable git checkout) by inspecting
`openjarvis.__file__`, then runs the right upgrade command. Supports
`--check` (print the command without running) and `-y` (skip the
confirmation prompt). The post-command "new version available" hint
now points users at this command instead of guessing at the right
flow.

**Desktop auto-update endpoint wired to the rolling
`desktop-latest` GitHub release.** The Tauri updater plugin was
configured on the build side (`createUpdaterArtifacts: true`,
`includeUpdaterJson: true`, signing key in `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`)
but inert on the runtime side (`active: false`, `endpoints: []`). The
installed desktop app would never check. Both are now fixed; the app
polls `releases/download/desktop-latest/latest.json` every 30 minutes
and signature-verifies downloads against the minisign pubkey baked
into the app. Full flow, key-rotation runbook, and dev escape hatch
(`OPENJARVIS_NO_UPDATER=1`) documented in `docs/desktop-auto-update.md`.

**Analytics env-var opt-out** (`DO_NOT_TRACK`, `OPENJARVIS_NO_ANALYTICS`).
Tanvir's analytics module (#351) only respected the
`[analytics] enabled` config-file setting. Both env vars are now
honored in `is_analytics_enabled()` and in the install.sh beacon
script. Any truthy value (`1`, `true`, `yes`, `on`) disables for
that process; env opt-out takes precedence over the config file.
Documented under a new "Opting out" section in `docs/telemetry.md`.

### Changed

**Version-check trigger widened.** The "new version available" hint
in `_version_check.py` used to fire only on `{ask, chat, serve}` and
hardcoded the wrong upgrade command (`git pull && uv sync` — only
correct for editable installs). Now fires on every interactive
command (`doctor`, `init`, `quickstart`, `model`, `agents`, `skill`,
`memory`, `bench`, `telemetry`, `config`, `eval`, `optimize`, plus
the original three) and uses install-detection to print the right
upgrade command. Honors `JARVIS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` and `CI=true` to
stay silent in automation.

**Desktop app version bumped 0.1.0 → 1.0.1** across
`tauri.conf.json`, `frontend/package.json`, and
`frontend/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` so the Python and desktop release
streams are aligned and the auto-updater has a real version to
compare against.

### Migration from 1.0.0

- **Importing `is_analytics_enabled`?** Same signature; behavior now
  short-circuits on env opt-out before checking the config. Callers
  that want the raw "is the config flag set" semantic should read
  `cfg.enabled` directly.
- **Editable-git users running `jarvis self-update`** get the
  detected `git pull && uv sync` command pointed at their actual
  checkout, not `~/OpenJarvis`. If you'd come to rely on the
  hardcoded path, update your muscle memory.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-15

The five-primitive architecture (Intelligence, Engine, Agents,
Tools & Memory, Learning) is now stable, with efficiency and
on-device learning as first-class capabilities alongside accuracy.
Companion blog post:
[From Minions to OpenJarvis: A Retrospective on Two Years in Local AI](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2026-05-19-minions-to-openjarvis-retrospective).

### Highlights

**Five composable primitives.** Intelligence, Engine, Agents, Tools & Memory,
and Learning each sit behind a single typed interface — any slot is
substitutable without touching the rest. The composition layer is
`JarvisSystem` in `src/openjarvis/system.py`, driven by a TOML config.

**Built-in agents across three execution modes.** Eight agents spanning a
single-turn chat baseline, a deep-research agent with inline citations,
a CodeAct-style coder, and a continuous monitor with memory compression
for long-horizon workflows. Execution modes cover on-demand, scheduled,
and continuous.

**Starter presets.** Eight preset configs installable via
`jarvis init --preset <name>` bundle an agent with a hardware-appropriate
engine, connectors, and tools. Variants cover Apple Silicon, Linux GPU
servers, and CPU-only laptops, plus a quickstart for LLM-guided spec search.

**Inference engines.** Four first-class local engines (Ollama, vLLM, SGLang,
llama.cpp) and five cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini,
OpenRouter, MiniMax) sit behind a single `Engine` interface. Discovery
in `engine/_discovery.py` picks a sensible default per host.

### Added — hybrid local-cloud capabilities

**Per-query routing via a query-complexity analyzer**
(`src/openjarvis/learning/routing/complexity.py`). Produces a 0.0–1.0
complexity score with code/math/reasoning signals and a suggested token
budget, populating `RoutingContext` so easy queries stay local and only
queries that need frontier capability escalate.

**LLM-guided spec search** (`src/openjarvis/learning/spec_search/`).
`SpecSearchOrchestrator` wires diagnose → plan → execute → gate into a
single learning session: a frontier model reads traces, proposes
coordinated edits across all five primitives, and a held-out benchmark
gate (`gate/benchmark_gate.py`, `gate/regression.py`, `gate/cold_start.py`)
accepts only non-regressing edits. Ships with the `spec-search-quickstart`
preset and a runnable tutorial at `examples/openjarvis/spec_search_quickstart.py`.

**Six hybrid coordination paradigms** in `src/openjarvis/agents/hybrid/`.
Each paradigm pairs a local student with a frontier cloud teacher under
a different orchestration shape, as `LocalCloudAgent` subclasses:

- `minions` — reactive single-local + single-cloud loop
- `conductor` — static DAG planner
- `advisors` — executor ↔ advisor loop
- `archon` — generate → rank → fuse
- `skillorchestra` — per-query router across local skills
- `toolorchestra` — RL'd local model with a tool pool

A runner CLI (`python -m openjarvis.agents.hybrid.runner --cell <name>`)
and a 35-cell experiment registry (one TOML per method × benchmark ×
model triple) let researchers run, score, and compare these on equal
footing. Includes a Modal-backed SWE-bench-Verified harness scorer
(`evals/scorers/swebench_harness.py`).

### Added — efficiency as a first-class constraint

**Hardware-agnostic energy telemetry at 50ms resolution** across NVIDIA
(`telemetry/energy_nvidia.py`), AMD (`telemetry/energy_amd.py`), Apple
Silicon (`telemetry/energy_apple.py`), and Intel RAPL
(`telemetry/energy_rapl.py`). Energy, dollar cost, FLOPs, and latency
are treated as evaluation targets alongside accuracy.

**Instrumentation for FLOPs, batch, steady-state, ITL, phase energy, and
vLLM-specific metrics.** Joined per-query by the aggregator
(`telemetry/aggregator.py`) so traces carry accuracy + efficiency together.

### Added — local learning loop

**Closed-loop optimization across the stack** — model weights via SFT
(`learning/intelligence/sft_trainer.py`) and GRPO
(`learning/intelligence/grpo_trainer.py` plus an orchestrator-specific
variant under `learning/intelligence/orchestrator/`), prompts via DSPy
(`learning/agents/dspy_optimizer.py`), agent logic via GEPA
(`learning/agents/gepa_optimizer.py`), and engine + stack configuration
via LLM-guided spec search. `LearningOrchestrator` coordinates triggers
and applies optimizer overlays at discovery time so improvements compound
across primitives.

### Added — cross-framework evaluation

**External agentic-framework evaluation via subprocess.** The
`evals/backends/external/` subpackage wraps Hermes Agent and OpenClaw as
one-shot subprocess backends behind the existing `InferenceBackend` ABC.
The `evals/comparison/` toolkit provides path + commit-pin enforcement
(`third_party.py`), config templating (`make_configs.py`), and LaTeX
table generation (`table_gen.py`).

Ships with a new optional extra `framework-comparison` (depends on
`polars`), a `live_external` pytest marker for integration tests
requiring real foreign-framework installations, and a `ToolOrchestra`
evaluation dataset (`evals/datasets/toolorchestra.py`) alongside the
existing 30+ benchmark suite.

### Added — Skills System (Plans 1, 2A, 2B)

- **Skills core** — every skill is a tool. Skills appear in a system prompt catalog, agents invoke them on demand, content (pipeline results, markdown instructions, or both) gets injected into context.
  - `SkillManifest` + `SkillStep` types with tags, depends, invocation flags, markdown content
  - `SkillManager` — discovery, precedence resolution, catalog XML generation, tool wrapping
  - `SkillTool(BaseTool)` — auto-extracts parameters from step argument templates
  - `SkillExecutor` — sequential pipeline execution with sub-skill delegation
  - Dependency graph with cycle detection, max depth enforcement, capability unions
  - Security: four trust tiers (bundled/indexed/unreviewed/workspace), capability-gated enforcement
  - Skill index module for git-backed registry search

- **agentskills.io spec adoption** — canonical `SKILL.md` format with YAML frontmatter following the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) open standard.
  - `SkillParser` with strict spec validation + tolerant field mapping via `FIELD_MAPPING` table
  - `ToolTranslator` for external tool name translation (Bash -> shell_exec, Read -> file_read, etc.)
  - Source resolvers: `HermesResolver`, `OpenClawResolver`, `GitHubResolver`
  - `SkillImporter` with provenance tracking (`.source` metadata files), optional script import
  - Sourced subdirectory layout (`~/.openjarvis/skills/<source>/<name>/`)

- **Skills learning loop** — trace tagging, pattern discovery, DSPy/GEPA optimization.
  - Trace metadata tagging: `skill`, `skill_source`, `skill_kind` flow through ToolExecutor -> TraceCollector -> TraceStep
  - `SkillDiscovery` wired into `SkillManager.discover_from_traces()` with kebab name normalization
  - `SkillOptimizer` — per-skill DSPy/GEPA wrapper that buckets traces and writes sidecar overlays
  - `SkillOverlay` — sidecar storage at `~/.openjarvis/learning/skills/<name>/optimized.toml`
  - `SkillManager._load_overlays()` applies optimized descriptions + few-shot examples at discovery time
  - `LearningOrchestrator._maybe_optimize_skills()` — opt-in auto-trigger

- **Skills benchmark harness** — 4-condition PinchBench evaluation.
  - I3 fix: `skill_few_shot_examples` wired through SystemBuilder -> `_run_agent` -> `ToolUsingAgent` -> `native_react.REACT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
  - `SkillBenchmarkRunner` — 4-condition x N-seed x M-task sweep with markdown report
  - `JarvisAgentBackend` accepts `skills_enabled` and `overlay_dir` kwargs
  - Conditions: `no_skills`, `skills_on`, `skills_optimized_dspy`, `skills_optimized_gepa`

- **CLI commands:**
  - `jarvis skill list` / `info` / `run` / `install` / `sync` / `sources` / `update` / `remove` / `search`
  - `jarvis skill discover` — mine traces for recurring tool patterns
  - `jarvis skill show-overlay` — inspect optimization output
  - `jarvis optimize skills` — run DSPy/GEPA per-skill optimization
  - `jarvis bench skills` — run the PinchBench skills benchmark

- **Agent prompt improvement:**
  - `native_react.REACT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` now includes "Using Skills" guidance that teaches agents to distinguish executable vs. instructional skill responses
  - `{skill_examples}` placeholder for optimized few-shot example injection

- **Configuration:**
  - `[skills]` section: `enabled`, `skills_dir`, `active`, `auto_discover`, `auto_sync`, `max_depth`, `sandbox_dangerous`
  - `[[skills.sources]]` section: `source`, `url`, `filter`, `auto_update`
  - `[learning.skills]` section: `auto_optimize`, `optimizer`, `min_traces_per_skill`, `optimization_interval_seconds`, `overlay_dir`
  - `SkillSourceConfig` and `SkillsLearningConfig` dataclasses

- **Documentation:**
  - `docs/user-guide/skills.md` — comprehensive user guide
  - `docs/architecture/skills.md` — technical deep-dive
  - `docs/tutorials/skills-workflow.md` — end-to-end tutorial
  - `docs/getting-started/configuration.md` — expanded with skills config sections
  - `CLAUDE.md` — updated architecture section

### Examples & Tutorials

- `examples/openjarvis/spec_search_quickstart.py` — runnable end-to-end
  LLM-guided spec search session.
- `docs/user-guide/llm-guided-spec-search.md` — paper-aligned user guide.
- `docs/architecture/learning.md` — Learning primitive deep-dive covering
  routing, spec search, optimizers, and the orchestrator.
- `docs/tutorials/` — code-companion, deep-research, messaging-hub,
  scheduled-ops, and skills-workflow walkthroughs.
- `src/openjarvis/agents/hybrid/registry/*.toml` — 35-cell registry of
  paradigm × benchmark × model experiments.

### Migration from 0.x

- **`learning/distillation/` is now `learning/spec_search/`.** The
  subsystem was renamed to match the LLM-guided spec search semantics
  documented in the companion paper. Update any imports
  (`from openjarvis.learning.distillation.*` →
  `from openjarvis.learning.spec_search.*`). The `jarvis distillation`
  CLI command is removed; use `spec_search`-prefixed config keys instead.
- **`_third_party.toml` no longer ships default paths.** Set
  `HERMES_AGENT_PATH` and `OPENCLAW_PATH` env vars to point at your
  local checkouts before running the framework-comparison harness;
  missing or empty paths now raise `ThirdPartyNotFoundError` with an
  actionable hint.
- **Engine `generate_full` return shape extended.**
  `JarvisAgentBackend.generate_full` and `JarvisDirectBackend.generate_full`
  now return the spec §6.2 extended fields (`energy_joules`,
  `peak_power_w`, `tool_calls`, `turn_count`, `framework`,
  `framework_commit`, `error`). Existing callers that didn't read these
  fields are unaffected; new callers can rely on cross-framework parity.

### Fixed

- **Trace metadata flow** — `ToolResult.metadata` now propagates through `TOOL_CALL_END` event to `TraceStep.metadata` (was silently dropped at the event-bus boundary).
- **TaintSet JSON serialization** — `ToolExecutor._json_safe_metadata()` filters non-JSON-serializable values (like `TaintSet`) from event payloads before they reach `TraceStore`.
- **Non-dict YAML frontmatter** — source resolvers handle `yaml.safe_load()` returning a string instead of a dict (discovered on real OpenClaw imports).
- **OpenClaw category/name queries** — `jarvis skill install openclaw:owner/slug` now correctly splits into category + name match.
- **SkillDiscovery trace compatibility** — `_extract_tool_sequence` reads from `step.input["tool"]` (the actual `TraceStep` format), not the nonexistent `step.tool_name` attribute.
- **LearningOrchestrator skill trigger** — `_maybe_optimize_skills` runs BEFORE the SFT-data short-circuit (skills are tagged via trace metadata, not mined as SFT pairs).
- **PinchBenchScorer constructor** — `SkillBenchmarkRunner` constructs `PinchBenchScorer(judge_backend, model)` instead of no-args.
- **EvalRunner results access** — reads per-task data from `eval_runner.results` property, not nonexistent `summary.results`.
